//! # The U12 Library
//!
//! A Rust library for representing 12-bit unsigned values. This is primarily useful 
//! for implementing Chip-8 assemblers and interpreters safely. The type implements bulk 
//! of the standard Rust literal semantics and operators, and much of the documentation 
//! is adapted from the u16 intrinsic type.
